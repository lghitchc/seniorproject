This is the code from a project done in 2024 when I was a senior at the University of Mississippi. 
The project is about Empty Nesters finding friends with other Empty Nesters.
Empty Nesters are people who have just sent their children off to college or to their job and are left with nothing to do.
Like a hole where caring for their child and constantly keeping up with them or helping them.
This project was meant to be a place for those people to gain more friends and allow these people to go and do things with others of the same "ailment".
